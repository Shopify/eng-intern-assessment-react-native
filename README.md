## Implementation

In crafting the stopwatch application, I've designed and integrated the following key features.

### Core Functionality

**Start, Stop, and Reset:**
Users can intuitively control the stopwatch with clear and responsive buttons. Clicking "Start" initiates counting, "Stop" halts the stopwatch, and "Reset" resets the timer to zero. These features have been implemented in StopWatch.tsx.

**Lap Recording:**
The application allows users to record and display laps. Each recorded lap is presented in a scrollable list for easy reference.

### Additional features:

**Clock:**
I implemented a visual clock component with a circle that rotates around the digital clock, providing users with a visual representation of elapsed time.

**Color-Coded Laps:**
The laps are not just recorded; they are visually differentiated. The fastest lap is displayed in green, while the slowest lap is red. This intuitive color coding makes it easy for users to identify and analyze their lap times.
