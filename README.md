This project is a simple stopwatch application built using React Native and TypeScript. The stopwatch provides basic functionality, allowing users to start, stop, reset, and record laps.

## Features
1. **Dynamic Clock Arm Rotation:**
   - The clock arm rotates dynamically based on the elapsed time.

2. **Start the Stopwatch:**
   - Press the "Start" button to begin counting time.
   - The timer increments every 10 milliseconds.

3. **Stop the Stopwatch:**
   - Press the "Stop" button to pause the timer.
   - The timer stops counting until resumed.

4. **Reset the Stopwatch:**
   - Press the "Reset" button to set the timer back to zero.
   - Clears any recorded laps.

5. **Record Laps:**
   - Press the "Lap" button to record the current time.
   - Recorded laps are displayed in a scrollable list.

## Project Goals

1. **Implemented Stopwatch Functionality:**
   - The stopwatch starts, stops, resets, and records laps as expected.
   - The `handleStartStop`, `handleStop`, `handleLap`, and `handleReset` functions control the stopwatch's behavior.

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Code is structured, modular, and follows React and TypeScript conventions.
   - Proper indentation, meaningful variable names, and clear comments enhance readability.

3. **Tested Code:**
   - The application has been tested to ensure that the stopwatch functions correctly.
   - Testing has verified that starting, stopping, resetting, and lap recording work as intended.
