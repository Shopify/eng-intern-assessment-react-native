- Dorian Chen

## Completed tasks
- [x] Start the stopwatch to begin counting time.
- [x] Stop the stopwatch to pause the timer.
- [x] Displays Laps when a button is pressed.
- [x] Reset the stopwatch to zero.

## Changes
- Added `StopWatch.tsx`, `StopWatchButton`, and `StopWatchLap` to be the main components for the stopwatch
- Created a `utils` folder for helper functions
- Modified tests slightly to remove redundant tests (more efficiently used the buttons in my implementation)
